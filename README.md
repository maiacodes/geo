# Geo-IP
Geo-IP is a small site I've created to get the geolocation and ISP data of IPs and domains. There are many many many sites on the internet that do this, however I wanted to create an experience that was ad-free, fast, and simple. I got bored of having to deal with sites that have an old database and go down constantly, so I created this site of my own, and it's completely open source.
